        <Typography variant="subtitle1" mb={2} gutterBottom>
          I'm very ambitious front-end developer looking for a role in
          established Tech company with the opportunity to work with the latest
          technologies on challenging and diverse projects.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="subtitle1" mb={2} gutterBottom>
          I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on
          improving my chops one design problem at a time.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="subtitle1" mb={2} gutterBottom>
          If I need to define myself in one sentence that would be a family
          person, a sports fanatic, and tech-obsessed ðŸ˜Š
